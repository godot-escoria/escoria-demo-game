# ESCBackground

**Extends:** [TextureRect](../TextureRect)

## Description

ESCBackground's purpose is to display a background image and receive input
events on the background. More precisely, the TextureRect under ESCBackground
does not receive events itself - if it did, it would also eat all events like
hotspot focusing and such. Instead, we set the TextureRect mouse filter to
MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE, and we use an Area2D node to receive the input events.

If ESCBackground doesn't contain a texture, it is important that its rect_size
is set over the whole scene, because its rect_size is then used to create the
Area2D node under it. If the rect_size is wrongly set, the background may
receive no input.

## Property Descriptions

### esc\_script

```gdscript
export var esc_script = ""
```

The ESC script connected to this background

### get\_full\_area\_rect2

```gdscript
func get_full_area_rect2() -> Rect2
```
