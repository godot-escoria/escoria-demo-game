# ESCBackground's purpose is to display a background image and receive input
# events on the background. More precisely, the TextureRect under ESCBackground
# does not receive events itself - if it did, it would also eat all events like
# hotspot focusing and such. Instead, we set the TextureRect mouse filter to
# MOUSE_FILTER_IGNORE, and we use an Area2D node to receive the input events.
#
# If ESCBackground doesn't contain a texture, it is important that its rect_size
# is set over the whole scene, because its rect_size is then used to create the
# Area2D node under it. If the rect_size is wrongly set, the background may
# receive no input.
