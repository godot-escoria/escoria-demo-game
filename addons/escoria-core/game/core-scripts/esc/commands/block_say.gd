# `block_say`
#
# `say` commands called subsequent to using the `block_say` command will reuse the
# dialog box type of the previous `say` command if both dialog box types between the two `say`
# commands match.
#
# Different dialog box types can be used across multiple `say` commands, with the latest one
# used being preserved for reuse by the next `say` command should the dialog box type specified by
# both `say` commands match.
#
# This reuse will continue until a call to `end_block_say` is made.
#
# Using `block_say` more than once prior to calling `end_block_say` is idempotent and has the 
# following behaviour:
#
# - If no `say` command has yet been encountered since the first use of `block_say`,
#   the result of using this command will be as described above.
# - If a `say` command has been encountered since the previous use of `block_say`,
#   the dialog box used with that `say` command will continue to be reused for subsequent
#   `say` commands should the dialog box type requested match. Note that the dialog box used with
#   the next `say` command may be different than the one currently being reused.
#
# Example:
# `block say`
# `say player "Picture's looking good."`
# `say player "And so am I."`
# `end_block_say`
#
# This example will reuse the same dialog box type since they are the same between both `say` calls.
