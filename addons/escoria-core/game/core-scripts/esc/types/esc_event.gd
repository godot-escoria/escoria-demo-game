## An event in Escoria.
##
## Events are triggered from various sources. Common events include:[br]
##[br]
## - `:setup` : This event is always the first to be called each time the room is visited.
##    It allows elements in the room to be prepared *before* the room is displayed to the
##    player (e.g. starting particle effects).[br]
## - `:ready` : This event is the second to be called each time the room is visited.
##    It is run immediately after `:setup` finishes execution, if it exists. Otherwise,
##    `:ready` will be the first event to run. Regardless, this event is run *after*
##    the room is displayed to the player, allowing cutscenes or animations to be
##    run once the room is visible.[br]
## - `:use <global id>` : Called from the current item when it is used with the item
##   with specified by `<global id>`.
extends ESCStatement
class_name ESCEvent

## Regex identifying an ESC event.
const REGEX = \
	'^:(?<name>[^|]+)( \\|\\s*(?<flags>( ' + \
	'(TK|NO_TT|NO_UI|NO_SAVE)' + \
	')+))?$'

## Prefix to identify this as an ESC event.
const PREFIX = ":"


## Valid event flags:[br]
## - `TK`: stands for "telekinetic". It means the player won't walk over to
##   the item to say the line.[br]
## - `NO_TT`: stands for "No tooltip". It hides the tooltip for the duration of
##   the event. Probably not very useful, because events having multiple
##   say commands in them are automatically hidden.[br]
## - `NO_UI`: stands for "No User Inteface". It hides the UI for the duration of
##Â   the event. Useful when you want something to look like a cut scene but not
##   disable input for skipping dialog.[br]
## - `NO_SAVE`: disables saving. Use this in cut scenes and anywhere a
##   badly-timed autosave would leave your game in a messed-up state.
