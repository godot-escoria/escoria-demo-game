# An event in the ESC language
#
# Events are triggered from various sources. Common events include
#
# * :setup : This event is always the first to be called each time the room is visited.
#    It allows elements in the room to be prepared *before* the room is displayed to the
#    player (e.g. starting particle effects).
# * :ready : This event is the second to be called each time the room is visited.
#    It is run immediately after `:setup` finishes execution, if it exists. Otherwise,
#    `:ready` will be the first event to run. Regardless, this event is run *after*
#    the room is displayed to the player, allowing cutscenes or animations to be
#    run once the room is visible.
# * :use <global id> Called from the current item when it is used with the item
#   with the global id <global id>

# Valid event flags
# * TK: stands for "telekinetic". It means the player won't walk over to
#   the item to say the line.
# * NO_TT: stands for "No tooltip". It hides the tooltip for the duration of
#   the event. Probably not very useful, because events having multiple
#   say commands in them are automatically hidden.
# * NO_UI: stands for "No User Inteface". It hides the UI for the duration of
#Â   the event. Useful when you want something to look like a cut scene but not
#   disable input for skipping dialog.
# * NO_SAVE: disables saving. Use this in cut scenes and anywhere a
#   badly-timed autosave would leave your game in a messed-up state.
