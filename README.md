# Escoria Rewrite

Libre framework for the creation of point-and-click adventure games with the MIT-licensed multi-platform game engine [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

It is designed so that you can claim it for yourself and modify it to match the needs of your specific game and team.

This repository is big rewrite of the original [Escoria framework](https://github.com/godotengine/escoria/tree/master). Its purpose is to make Escoria work as a plugin for the Godot Engine editor, instead of being a collection of scripts and scenes. It is intended to be easier to use and easier to maintain. 

If you're encountering issues or incompatibilities, please raise an issue on [Escoria's Github repository](https://github.com/godotengine/escoria/issues).

## History

This framework was initially developed for the adventure game
[The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy®](http://store.steampowered.com/app/330420)
and later streamlined for broader usages and open sourced as promised to the backers of the Dog Mendonça Kickstarter campaign.

Because of maintainability issues and to make the framework easier for new developers and bring it closer to Godot's standards, the framework was completely rewritten and optimized.
