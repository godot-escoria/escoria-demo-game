# Escoria

Libre framework for the creation of point-and-click adventure games with
the MIT-licensed multi-platform game engine [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org).

*Escoria* consists of a set of scripts, template scenes and a dialogue
scripting language, which are all meant to be used within Godot Engine.

It takes advantage of the Godot features and editor, and is meant to be
usable by a team to make a game with little intervention from programmers.
It is designed so that you can claim it for yourself and modify it to match
the needs of your specific game and team.

## History

This framework was initially developed for the adventure game
[The Interactive Adventures of Dog Mendonça and Pizzaboy®](http://store.steampowered.com/app/330420)
and later streamlined for broader usages and open sourced as promised
to the backers of the Dog Mendonça Kickstarter campaign.

## Usage

Here be dragons.

## Documentation

This repository contains some basic documentation in the `doc` folder.

An extensive manual named [*Creating Point and Click Games with Escoria*](https://fr.flossmanuals.net/creating-point-and-click-games-with-escoria/)
was written during a booksprint by Ariel Manzur (@punto-), main developer of this framework,
and the [FLOSS Manuals francophone](https://fr.flossmanuals.net/) community.
